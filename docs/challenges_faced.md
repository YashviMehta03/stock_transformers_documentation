## LSTM's
* Figuring out which features to use for feature engineering which would produce best results
* Experimenting with hgih volatile stocks for which LSTM doesnt give good results
  
## Transformers
* Not producing expected results for either of the stocks so we had to figure out the reason behinf why transformers failed in doing so

## Informers
* Understanding the code as only one official resource was available
* Deciding parameters for the best predictions
* Figuring out best results for daily predictions
