# Transformer

## What are Transformers?

Transformers are neural network architectures that excel in handling sequential data by using self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of each element in the sequence. Unlike traditional models, transformers process input in parallel, allowing for faster training and better handling of long-range dependencies.

## Why are Transformers not ideal for Time Series Forecasting?
